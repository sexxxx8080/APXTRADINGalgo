Trading Algorithm Development

This repository contains algorithms designed for day-to-day and week-to-week trading, leveraging market data to inform decision-making.

Features

Data Integration: Utilizes real-time and historical market data to inform trading strategies.

Algorithmic Strategies: Implements various trading strategies, including trend-following, mean reversion, and arbitrage.

Backtesting Framework: Includes tools to test algorithms against historical data to evaluate performance.

Risk Management: Incorporates risk assessment measures to manage exposure and protect capital.


Installation

1. Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trading-algorithms.git


2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

cd trading-algorithms


3. Set Up a Virtual Environment:

python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`


4. Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt



Usage

1. Configure API Keys: Ensure you have the necessary API keys for data providers and trading platforms. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your keys:

API_KEY=your_api_key
API_SECRET=your_api_secret


2. Run Backtesting: Test your algorithms against historical data:

python backtest.py --strategy=strategy_name --data=data_file.csv


3. Deploy Live Trading: Execute algorithms in a live trading environment:

python live_trading.py --strategy=strategy_name
